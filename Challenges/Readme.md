# Guide To Submit Your Solutions
You should submit your solutions through the ELMS system, under the course name and the challenge name, regarding the module number, or if you don’t have access to the ELMS, email your code as described below.

## Instructions To Email Your code
1.	Email your solutions to, Samani.Academy@Gmail.Com
2.	For each module challenge, you should send an email with the subject of the Course ID and, after that, “CH” and then challenge number(these parts should separate with a hyphen ); for example, if you send your solution for challenge 1, your email subject should look like as follows:

                                APC-230107013-CH-1

3.	For each challenge, you should design your solution in a separate file with the challenge name; for example, if your code is for challenge CH1, your file name should look like as follows:

                                    CH1.fig

4.	On the top of each design file, you should write your name and your email within a comment section and a short description of the challenge, like as follow:

```py
    """
    *   Designer    : Ali Samanipour
    *   Email       : AliSamanipour.Official@Gmail.Com
    *   Description : This is a redesign of Amazon.com login page 
    """
```
5.	if you send your solutions as files, first Zip all of your solution in one file and name it like as follows:

```
<Your First Name First Character>.<Your Last Name>_<CH No>.zip
```
For example, for challenge 1 and regarding my name, the file name should be:
                        
                         A.Samanipour_CH1.zip
6. if your solution is online, just send the link
